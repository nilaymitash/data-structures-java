# data-structures-java
Data structures implemented in Java

Pre-req: Any Java version should be fine since this project contains basic core java programs.

You can use an IDE, however for learning purposes, I recommend using a text-editor and terminal/command prompt.

You can also use VS Code without any Java extensions. It will highlight keywords but will not auto-complete anything.

## How to compile and run
1. Navigate to the root folder "data-structures-java" in your terminal.
2. use `javac` command to compile class under any folder using this pattern `javac <folder_name>/<class_name>.java`. For ex: `javac arrays/Main.java`. This will produce a compiled executable ".class" file right next to the ".java" file.
3. Lastly, to run the compiled class file, use this command pattern: `java <package_name>.<class_name>`. For ex: `java arrays.Main`
